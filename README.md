# Advent of code 2022
This holiday season, I will do my best to do the Advent of Code challenges! My first thought was to do the challenges in a new language (I wanna learn Haskell so bad), but I didn't have the time to get up to par with what I need in a new language, so I will resort to Python for the first few challenges. Maybe all of them.

...oh well.
