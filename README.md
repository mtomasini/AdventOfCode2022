# Advent of code 2022
This holiday season, I will do my best to do the Advent of Code challenges! My first thought was to do the challenges in a new language (I wanna learn Haskell so bad), but I didn't have the time to get up to par with what I need in a new language, so I will resort to Python for the first few challenges. Maybe all of them.

...oh well.

Here's some notes about different days:
1) On day 1 I had to get back on some basics. It took me longer than I'd like to admit. I got "stuck" right in the beginning thinking about a proper way of doing it, noticing right away that `np.loadtxt()` skips empty lines, which made me re-evaluate. I ended up using pandas as main tool for resolution. The rest is just some `for` loops. I did the second part very roughly, without much thought.
2) Bah, I did stuff without thinking and ended up just hard coding it. Took me about 1 hour to finish. In hindsight, one thing that could have made my life much easier was to determine a dictionary and a scoring point matrix. 
3) Day 3 was kinda fun, I liked it because it's something I don't normally do (finding common elements in strings). While it could be done better, I'm happy that I was able to solve the issue I had on day 2 with the `assign()` function. All it needed was using `apply()` instead of `assign()`.
4) Ooooh such a nice exercise today. I enjoyed it. I'm quite happy I was able to find the function `split()`. I'm learning so much about python despite having worked with it for so many years. It turns out that all I needed was to vary the problems I needed to solve. 
5) Today was not a smooth ride at all. The problem of parsing was interesting and I'm quite happy about how I solved it. However, I realized late that I parsed into a data format that did not allow me to use `.pop()` and `.assign`, so I switched all by some hard coding. I shoud have thought a bit more ahead.
