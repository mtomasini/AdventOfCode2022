# Advent of code 2022
This holiday season, I will do my best to do the Advent of Code challenges! My first thought was to do the challenges in a new language (I wanna learn Haskell so bad), but I didn't have the time to get up to par with what I need in a new language, so I will resort to Python for the first few challenges. Maybe all of them.

...oh well.

Here's some notes about different days:
1) On day 1 I had to get back on some basics. It took me longer than I'd like to admit. I got "stuck" right in the beginning thinking about a proper way of doing it, noticing right away that `np.loadtxt()` skips empty lines, which made me re-evaluate. I ended up using pandas as main tool for resolution. The rest is just some `for` loops. I did the second part very roughly, without much thought.
2) Bah, I did stuff without thinking and ended up just hard coding it. Took me about 1 hour to finish. In hindsight, one thing that could have made my life much easier was to determine a dictionary and a scoring point matrix. 
3) Day 3 was kinda fun, I liked it because it's something I don't normally do (finding common elements in strings). While it could be done better, I'm happy that I was able to solve the issue I had on day 2 with the `assign()` function. All it needed was using `apply()` instead of `assign()`.
4) Ooooh such a nice exercise today. I enjoyed it. I'm quite happy I was able to find the function `split()`. I'm learning so much about python despite having worked with it for so many years. It turns out that all I needed was to vary the problems I needed to solve. 
5) Today was not a smooth ride at all. The problem of parsing was interesting and I'm quite happy about how I solved it. However, I realized late that I parsed into a data format that did not allow me to use `.pop()` and `.assign`, so I switched all by some hard coding. I shoud have thought a bit more ahead.
6) Such a good and easy day! I had right away the good idea for this, and I wrote a general function for the window sliding, so that the second part took me a couple of minutes. Very happy to have made it so far. Now from what I understand the hard part starts...
7) Woah. Tough. I had a good idea, but implementing the class took so much... I used a cool little library called `anytree`! Very cool, but took some time.
8) The algorithm was honestly easy, but I got stuck on indexes counts. That was a mess to figure out. And also, for the future remember that relative index of a chunk of row in `pandas` keeps the original indexes! 
9) I'm happy that I came up with the right idea right away, although it proved difficult to get the logics right, especially with the "long horse" movement (whose secret was hidden in the text)...
10) Another very fun day! Not the most difficult, to be honest, and it was interesting to think of this little puzzle. Very very happy!
