# Advent of code 2022
This holiday season, I will do my best to do the Advent of Code challenges! My first thought was to do the challenges in a new language (I wanna learn Haskell so bad), but I didn't have the time to get up to par with what I need in a new language, so I will resort to Python for the first few challenges. Maybe all of them.

...oh well.

Here's some notes about different days:
1) On day 1 I had to get back on some basics. It took me longer than I'd like to admit. I got "stuck" right in the beginning thinking about a proper way of doing it, noticing right away that `np.loadtxt()` skips empty lines, which made me re-evaluate. I ended up using pandas as main tool for resolution. The rest is just some `for` loops. I did the second part very roughly, without much thought.
